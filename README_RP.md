# Responsive Portfolio

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked to create a fully responsive design webpage that renders well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Building off Bootstrap CSS frameworks, this portfolio  page has a navbarm, a responsive layout, and responsive images and social media links.

First, I created the following files: 'index.html', 'portfolio.html' and 'contact.html,' and their corresponding CSS files. Once the HTML and CSS files were linked, I added HTML semantics and with the Bootsrap CSS navbar. Early on I focused on the navbar and footer functionality because it's code is uniform on each webpage.
