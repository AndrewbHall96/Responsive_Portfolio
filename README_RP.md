# Responsive Portfolio

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked to create a fully responsive design webpage that renders well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Building off Bootstrap CSS frameworks, this portfolio  page has a navbarm, a responsive layout, and responsive images and social media links.

First, I created the following files: 'index.html', 'portfolio.html' and 'contact.html,' and their corresponding CSS files. Once the HTML and CSS files were linked, I added HTML semantics and with the Bootsrap CSS navbar. Early on I focused on the navbar and footer elements because the code defining them is uniform throughout the website.

On the index page, within the main section, I created a card titled "About Me" with an image and paragraph placed inside. This was relatively easy since there were few elements to adjust.

On the portfolio page, I created one card and placed 8 images within it with captions banners floating in front of each image. To place each image, I created a grid system of rows and colomns. Looking back, it might be easier to create 8 cards, each containing  one image, and adjusting the grid from there.

On my contact page, I used a Bootstrap form code, creating with an email name, email, and message prompt.
